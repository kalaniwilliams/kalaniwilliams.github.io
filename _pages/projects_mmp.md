# Diagnostics

Diagnostic assays for marine mammal parasites can be used to diagnose animals in rehabilitation. Marine mammals, when sick, often become stranded on beaches and are taken in by rehabilitation facilities. Once diagnosed, they can be provided with specialized treatment plans and hopefully be released back into the wild once they have recovered. We design molecular diagnostic assays that are specific, sensitive, and as non-invasive to the animal as possible. Many of our assays rely on feces or sputum (although some require blood), which would make them ideal candidates for surveyin parasite infection levels in wild populations.

[**A novel quantitative real-time PCR diagnostic assay for fecal and nasal swab detection of an otariid lungworm,** ***Parafilaroides decorus***](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2020.04.012)

**Abstract**

*Parafilaroides decorus*, also known as sea lion lungworm, is a metastrongyloid nematode that infects otariid hosts, such as the charismatic California sea lion, *Zalophus californianus*. *P. decorus* causes bronchointerstitial pneumonia, respiratory distress, reduced ability to swim, dive and hunt and as a result, increased mortality particularly in young animals. Respiratory disease is a leading cause of stranding and admission to rehabilitation centers on the Pacific coast. Low-coverage genomic sequencing of four *P. decorus* individuals analyzed through Galaxy's RepeatExplorer identified a novel repeat DNA family we employed to design a sensitive quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for diagnosing infections from fecal or sputum samples. The assay detects as little as 10 fg of *P. decorus* DNA and a linear regression model developed using a standard curve can be used to estimate the concentration of *P. decorus* DNA in a sample, Â± 0.015 ng. This knowledge can be leveraged to estimate the level of parasite burden, which can be used to design improved treatments for animals in rehabilitation. Improved treatment of infections will aid in more animals being successfully released back into the wild.
